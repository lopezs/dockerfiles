# PostgreSQL docker image

This is a slightly modified version of the official docker image, just sets the locale to en_GB

## To build image

docker build -t lopezs/postgres .


## Environment Variables

### `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

This environment variable is recommended for you to use the PostgreSQL image. This environment variable sets the superuser password for PostgreSQL. The default superuser is defined by the `POSTGRES_USER` environment variable. In the above example, it is being set to "mysecretpassword".

### `POSTGRES_USER`

This optional environment variable is used in conjunction with `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to set a user and its password. This variable will create the specified user with superuser power and a database with the same name. If it is not specified, then the default user of `postgres` will be used.

### `PGDATA`

This optional environment variable can be used to define another location - like a subdirectory - for the database files. The default is `/var/lib/postgresql/data`, but if the data volume you're using is a fs mountpoint (like with GCE persistent disks), Postgres `initdb` recommends a subdirectory (for example `/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata` ) be created to contain the data.

### `POSTGRES_DB`

This optional environment variable can be used to define a different name for the default database that is created when the image is first started. If it is not specified, then the value of `POSTGRES_USER` will be used.

### `POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS`

This optional environment variable can be used to send arguments to `postgres initdb`. The value is a space separated string of arguments as `postgres initdb` would expect them. This is useful for adding functionality like data page checksums: `-e POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS="--data-checksums"`.
